### Unit 1 Project

My unit one project is an adaptation of the word card game called Quiddler. 

This version will be a single player competing against the computer. Like many cardgames, players are dealt hands of shuffled cards and take turns picking up a facedown card from a 'pickup-pile' or a faceup card from a discard pile. In this game, each card represents a letter and player's objective is to write word/s using the same number of cards dealt that round. There are 8 rounds. In round 1, each player is dealt 3 cards, starting with the guest player. Again, guest first, players alternate picking up and discarding one card until one of them is able to use all of the letters in a word. Words must be at least two letters in length. Because different letters have different point values, the player who has the most points wins. 

To keep this version simple, yet scaleable, 
....                                                     
in another object property. Once someone checks out, the other player is offered a final opportunity to pick up, use their letters in words, and discard. Their correct word will be tallied for points and unused letters will be deducted. Finally, any time someone uses all of their letters in a single word, a bonus 5 points will e added to their score. The venter of the screen will have the pickup and discard piles, tthe players hand will be bottom center, the computers hidden hand will be illustrated by a pile of plain card. A scoreboard for each player will be updated in real time in a location TBA. I like the candy crush layout with drag and drop capabilities, but I don't know how to handle the incrementally increasing hand lengths by round."
